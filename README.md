# Weather Forecast Web App

## Overview

This project aims to further my learning as a software engineer by creating a functional weather forecast web application using Node.js and JavaScript. The software demonstrates the ability to fetch and display weather forecasts based on user-entered locations. It incorporates various JavaScript concepts, including ES6 functions, recursion, and handling API requests using a third-party library.

The primary purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of JavaScript language syntax and modern web development practices. Additionally, this project helps in mastering the integration of external APIs and deploying web applications to cloud platforms.
